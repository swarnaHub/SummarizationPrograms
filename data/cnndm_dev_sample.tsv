(CNN)On the 6th of April 1996, San Jose Clash and DC United strode out in front of 31,683 expectant fans at the Spartan Stadium in San Jose, California.|||The historic occasion was the first ever Major League Soccer match -- a brave new dawn for the world's favorite sport in a land its charms had yet to conquer.|||Summarizing the action for ESPN, commentator Ty Keough eagerly described the momentous "birth of a new era for American soccer."|||Looking back at footage from that balmy evening now it's hard not to feel a certain nostalgia.|||Baggy shirts, questionable hairstyles and strange rule adaptations to make games more exciting were all part of the formative MLS experience.|||Countdown clocks were employed to provide drama at the end of each half.|||Even more bizarrely, tied games were settled by shootouts that saw attacking players run with the ball from 35-yards out before attempting to beat the opposing goalkeeper.|||As the MLS prepares to mark the beginning of its 20th season, it's hard to comprehend just how much the league has progressed in the intervening period.|||Long gone is the desire to tamper with the rules of the game for a start.|||Attendances are higher than ever before while the number of teams involved has doubled from 10 in the 1996 campaign to 20 in 2015.|||A further four are set to be added by 2020.|||On top of this, the new season is the first of a new domestic TV and media rights deal with FOX, ESPN and Univision worth $700 million over eight years.|||This figure may pale beside the $5.1 billion recently paid by UK broadcasters for the English Premier League, the richest football league in the world, but it represents a tripling in value of the previous MLS deal.|||According to Phil Rawlins, co-primary owner and president of the new MLS franchise, Orlando City Soccer Club, "the industry and the game itself has moved on dramatically" in the U.S..|||He believes what would equal 50 years growth in most other industries has been experienced in the first two decades of the MLS.|||Rawlins' club is a prime example of this rapid transformation.|||He describes players being pushed out of changing facilities because of a schedule clash with a yoga class not so long ago.|||This weekend 60,000 fans are expected to witness Orlando City's opening weekend fixture against New York City, another new club making their MLS bow.|||World Cup winners Kaka and David Villa will turn out for Orlando and New York City respectively.|||"We're just on the crest of the wave at the moment," Rawlins said of football's American progress.|||"Can it be the number two, number three sport in this country?|||Yes, I think it can.|||And it can be in a short space of time."|||These positive assertions are backed by the huge interest U.S. fans showed in last year's World Cup in Brazil.|||Team USA's group stage clash with Portugal attracted 25 million viewers, according to figures from TV ratings firm, Nielsen.|||That's considerably more than the 15 million baseball's 2013 World Series averaged on FOX or the similar audience that tuned into the 2014 NBA finals on ABC.|||Anyone who saw 20,000 pumped-up young fans pack out Chicago's Grant Park to cheer on their country via big screens, meanwhile, would find it hard to argue against soccer in the U.S. now being anything other than a big deal.|||Reaching this promising stage, however, has been anything but a smooth ride.|||The MLS was reported to have lost as much as $250 million in its first five years while average attendances initially dwindled after the inaugural season.|||Three teams -- Miami Fusion, Tampa Bay Mutiny (both in 2001) and Chivas USA (2014) -- were disbanded along the way due to a mixture of lack of fan interest and ownership troubles.|||A report by Forbes at the end of 2013, meanwhile, claimed that only 10 out of 19 MLS teams were profitable.|||And as recently as this week, MLS players looked like they could be going on strike over wages and the right of players to become free agents when their contracts end.|||Then there's the way the league develops, attracts and trades players.|||A salary cap restricts the amount teams can spend on playing squads.|||Each side, however, has a number of spaces that can be allocated to "off budget" signings which are not included within the cap.|||This includes promising Generation Adidas players who enter the MLS through the draft systems before completing their college education.|||Homegrown players from club's development academies are also exempt as are a maximum of three designated players (DPs), usually stellar international names whose wages and transfer fees will be covered by club owners or sponsors.|||One of the main criticisms of the MLS and its complex player acquisition rulebook is that while it does entice prominent stars of the game like David Beckham, Freddie Ljungberg and Thierry Henry to appear in the MLS, it only does so when their careers are on a downward trajectory.|||Why would an exceptional player want to move to a league that can only attract a handful of top talents at any one time, after all?|||And herein lies one of the leagues biggest challenges in attracting and keeping the talented players fans want to see.|||Although the likes of the salary cap encourages fiscal probity, it means MLS teams are restricted by rules clubs in other markets are not.|||Head coach of Sporting Kansas, Peter Vermes, highlighted these difficulties in comments carried by the Kansas City Star newspaper last year.|||"We're in a place where at times you can't compete with foreign clubs because of the kind of dynamics they have in regards to finances.|||We have a salary cap.|||They don't," Vermes said.|||According to Paulo Teixeira, a football agent who has worked to bring in and sell players from the league in recent years, current philosophies with regards player-trading may be have to be tweaked to help the MLS grow yet further.|||He describes the importance of placing an emphasis on attracting younger players with European passports.|||Such talented individuals will have a sell-on value that can be recouped by the league and their clubs if they move on from the MLS to the biggest and wealthiest leagues across the Atlantic.|||Theoretically, at least, this money can then be reinvested in the league, player development and attracting yet more promising players to the MLS.|||This in turn will raise the standard further.|||An early example of this strategy can perhaps be found in the transfer of Oriol Rossell, a Spanish midfielder who moved from Sporting Kansas to Sporting Lisbon last year in a deal brokered by Teixeira.|||Rossell arrived on a free transfer aged 20 after being released by FC Barcelona in 2012.|||He excelled at Kansas, winning the MLS Cup before being sold to the Portuguese giants at a profit in June 2014.|||Teixeira is quick to make clear such plans would need good scouting systems to truly flourish.|||It could also be achieved by signing DPs closer to the peak stage of their career, he added.|||This last point is something that appears be happening already.|||"Before they used to have a lot of big names who could no longer run in Europe," Teixeira said.|||"(But) Villa is not an old guy, (Frank) Lampard is still going strong" and both could still offer something to teams in Europe, he said by way of example of New York City's first DP signings.|||Nevertheless, he continued, the signing of more young players with big potential  "is probably something we'll see more of."|||Whether Teixeira is correct will become apparent in the months and years ahead.|||Either way, that brave new MLS dawn that broke over San Jose back in 1996 has turned into a bright morning.|||CNN's Don Riddell

(CNN)My vote for Father of the Year goes to Curt Schilling.|||The former Major League Baseball pitcher recently fired off a series of fastballs and mowed down a group of Twitter trolls who made the mistake of tweeting vulgar and sexually-explicit comments about Schilling's teenage daughter.|||The drama started, innocently enough, on February 25, when Schilling played the role of a proud father.|||He sent a tweet congratulating his daughter, Gabby, on being accepted to Salve Regina University, where she'll play softball.|||It read: "Congrats to Gabby Schilling who will pitch for the Salve Regina Seahawks next year!!|||— Curt Schilling (@gehrig38)" Almost immediately, responses came in from young men, complete strangers who apparently followed Schilling on Twitter.|||The tweets quickly went from immature, to creepy, to repugnant.|||Threats of rape were common.|||The tweets were deleted, and the accounts were closed after this story went viral.|||But not before Schilling captured some of the images and posted them on his blog.|||What was said about 17-year-old Gabby Schilling wasn't just obnoxious.|||It was vile and obscene.|||What was said wasn't just mean and ugly.|||It was threatening and scary.|||As a parent, it's the kind of thing that makes you rethink your opposition to public caning as a logical punishment for such transgressions.|||These misogynistic cowards may have thought they could hide in the darkness of anonymity, the sort that many have come to expect from social media sites, where you feel free to be a  despicable human being because, you think, no one will ever find out who you really are and hold you accountable for your words.|||If so, they thought wrong.|||They couldn't hide.|||They were found out, and they got the throttling they so richly deserved.|||Thanks to dad.|||According to Schilling, who made it his mission to track down these cretins and make sure those they associate with know who they really are, two people have already paid a price due to their tweets.|||One was a student disc jockey at a community college in New Jersey, who was suspended, and the other was a part-time ticket seller for the New York Yankees, who was fired.|||Concerned that this is an example of exactly the kind of cyberbullying that leads some teenagers to commit suicide, Schilling is also thinking about taking legal action against some of the other people involved.|||Bravo for him.|||I'm sure that, all across America, dads with daughters -- after reading some of the horrible things that were said about this young girl -- are marveling at Schilling's self-control.|||I have two daughters of my own, and he's a better man than me.|||If ever there was a case where profanity-spewing malcontents deserved to have their mouths washed out with soap, this is it.|||So what additional insights can we draw, and what larger lessons can we learn, from this unexpected but predictable collision of old-fashioned parenthood and newfangled media?|||There are a few.|||The first is about accountability, the very thing that the young men who posted these hurtful messages were trying to avoid.|||But Schilling wouldn't let them.|||At their best, social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and others allow the sharing the information and the building of a sense of community.|||At their worst, they become digital sandboxes and locker rooms where people think have a license to misbehave without having to worry about consequences.|||We need to applaud efforts like this that promote greater online accountability.|||There's also something to be said about protective parents, and how essential they are to a working society.|||We should still be concerned about those overprotective parents who hover like helicopters from little league to job interviews.|||We shouldn't bubblewrap our kids, and keep them from playing outdoors, and then sit around wondering why they're soft, timid, and risk-averse.|||But protective parents -- the kind who shield their kids from real danger -- never go out of style.|||A parent's top job is to protect his children.|||Schilling did his job.|||Finally, it's worth reminding everyone that freedom of expression does not mean freedom from rules, standards, and expectations that should guide your behavior.|||There are things you don't say.|||There are boundaries, ways that we expect you to behave so you don't terrorize other people or bring shame upon yourself, your friends, and your family.|||If you don't have social skills, you don't belong on social media.|||The tweets make you wince.|||But in this story, you'll still find plenty to smile about.|||This whole drama unfolded because Schilling was proud of his daughter.|||Now, given how he reacted, we all have reason to be proud of him.|||​ .

(CNN)Share, and your gift will be multiplied.|||That may sound like an esoteric adage, but when Zully Broussard selflessly decided to give one of her kidneys to a stranger, her generosity paired up with big data.|||It resulted in six patients receiving transplants.|||That surprised and wowed her.|||"I thought I was going to help this one person who I don't know, but the fact that so many people can have a life extension, that's pretty big," Broussard told CNN affiliate KGO.|||She may feel guided in her generosity by a higher power.|||"Thanks for all the support and prayers," a comment on a Facebook page in her name read.|||"I know this entire journey is much bigger than all of us.|||I also know I'm just the messenger."|||CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the page.|||But the power that multiplied Broussard's gift was data processing of genetic profiles from donor-recipient pairs.|||It works on a simple swapping principle but takes it to a much higher level, according to California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco.|||So high, that it is taking five surgeons, a covey of physician assistants, nurses and anesthesiologists, and more than 40 support staff to perform surgeries on 12 people.|||They are extracting six kidneys from donors and implanting them into six recipients.|||"The ages of the donors and recipients range from 26 to 70 and include three parent and child pairs, one sibling pair and one brother and sister-in-law pair," the medical center said in a statement.|||The chain of surgeries is to be wrapped up Friday.|||In late March, the medical center is planning to hold a reception for all 12 patients.|||Here's how the super swap works, according to California Pacific Medical Center.|||Say, your brother needs a kidney to save his life, or at least get off of dialysis, and you're willing to give him one of yours.|||But then it turns out that your kidney is not a match for him, and it's certain his body would reject it.|||Your brother can then get on a years-long waiting list for a kidney coming from an organ donor who died.|||Maybe that will work out -- or not, and time could run out for him.|||Alternatively, you and your brother could look for another recipient-living donor couple like yourselves -- say, two more siblings, where the donor's kidney isn't suited for his sister, the recipient.|||But maybe your kidney is a match for his sister, and his kidney is a match for your brother.|||So, you'd do a swap.|||That's called a paired donation.|||It's a bit of a surgical square dance, where four people cross over partners temporarily and everybody goes home smiling.|||But instead of a square dance, Broussard's generous move set off a chain reaction, like dominoes falling.|||Her kidney, which was removed Thursday, went to a recipient, who was paired with a donor.|||That donor's kidney went to the next recipient, who was also paired with a donor, and so on.|||On Friday, the last donor will give a kidney to someone who has been biding time on one of those deceased donor lists to complete the chain.|||Such long-chain transplanting is rare.|||It's been done before, California Pacific Medical Center said in a statement, but matching up the people in the chain has been laborious and taken a long time.|||That changed when a computer programmer named David Jacobs received a kidney transplant.|||He had been waiting on a deceased donor list, when a live donor came along -- someone nice enough to give away a kidney to a stranger.|||Jacobs paid it forward with his programming skills, creating MatchGrid, a program that genetically matches up donor pairs or chains quickly.|||"When we did a five-way swap a few years ago, which was one of the largest, it took about three to four months.|||We did this in about three weeks," Jacobs said.|||But this chain wouldn't have worked so quickly without Broussard's generosity -- or may not have worked at all.|||"The significance of the altruistic donor is that it opens up possibilities for pairing compatible donors and recipients," said Dr. Steven Katznelson.|||"Where there had been only three or four options, with the inclusion of the altruistic donor, we had 140 options to consider for matching donors and recipients."|||And that's divine, Broussard's friend Shirley Williams wrote in a comment her on Broussard's Facebook page.|||"You are a true angel my friend."

London (CNN)A photo of a weasel hitching a surprise lift on the back of a flying woodpecker near London has gone viral on Twitter, with more than 7,000 users retweeting the original post of the image.|||It was first posted by photographer Jason Ward on Monday and credited to Martin Le-May.|||After #WeaselPecker gained momentum, British media soon picked up the story, and television channel ITV interviewed Le-May.|||The amateur photographer from Essex, near London, told the broadcaster he had been walking with his wife in Hornchurch Country Park, Essex, when they heard "a distressed squawking" noise and spotted the woodpecker.|||"Just after I switched from my binoculars to my camera the bird flew across us and slightly in our direction; suddenly it was obvious it had a small mammal on its back and this was a struggle for life," Le-May said.|||Eventually, Le-May told ITV, the weasel -- known as a "least weasel" in some countries -- lost its grip and the bird flew away.|||Marina Pacheco, chief executive of Britain's Mammal Society told CNN the image looked genuine and that it was possible an omnivorous weasel would take on a woodpecker.|||"Weasels will go for anything that looks like food -- they've got a high metabolism and they've got to eat a lot," she said.|||"It doesn't surprise me that a weasel took a punt -- I've seen a photo of a weasel charging a group of sparrows, they're very hungry animals."|||But she said the weasel, which would generally try to break the neck of its prey to subdue it, may have exceeded its abilities in this case.|||"I think it was a bit of a long shot -- it looks like it tried to grab the neck of the woodpecker to break it," Pacheco said.|||"I think that it probably doesn't have a big enough jaw to bite through the spine of the woodpecker."|||Weasels would not normally target green woodpeckers, Pacheco said -- their predators are normally the size of a stoat or larger.|||But the birds are known to spend a fair amount of time on the ground pulling up worms and hunting insects.|||"If the woodpecker had managed to hit the weasel with its beak it would have been the end of the weasel," she said.|||"They're quite gung-ho little creatures."|||The pluckiness of the weasel spawned a number of parodies on Twitter, with manipulated images showing the creature in turn being ridden by Russian President Vladimir Putin, popstar Miley Cyrus, football star John Terry -- and even what appears to be a dog red panda dressed in a Darth Vader costume.|||(Update: Twitter has now educated us on the difference between a dog and a red panda.|||Sorry, Darth!)|||As for the bird?|||The green woodpecker is also known as a "yaffle" for its laughing call.|||After the shock of being targeted by a hungry weasel wears off, we can only hope it lives up to its nickname.

(CNN)A Pennsylvania community is pulling together to search for an eighth-grade student who has been missing since Wednesday.|||The search has drawn hundreds of volunteers on foot and online.|||The parents of Cayman Naib, 13, have been communicating through the Facebook group "Find Cayman" since a day after his disappearance, according to close friend David Binswanger.|||Newtown Police say Cayman was last seen wearing a gray down winter jacket, black ski pants and hiking boots.|||He could be in the Radnor-Wayne area, roughly 20 miles from Philadelphia, or may have purchased a train ticket to Philadelphia, according to an alert posted on Facebook.|||"We think that he got a email from school and was upset by it and left as an impulsive act," Farid Naib, Cayman's father, wrote Thursday on the group page.|||"We have spoken to his friends and they do not know where he is.|||Cayman does have his phone, we don't know if he has any cash, he does not have his wallet."|||The parents said that his phone was out of power at the time.|||"Cayman left within 30 minutes after he received an email from school regarding overdue home work (we do not blame the school) and most probably did not do any pre planning ...|||He is a good kid, and has no substance abuse or other issues, this is the first time he has ever done anything like this," his father and mother, Becky Naib, posted Friday.|||The parents wrote Saturday that Cayman was not wearing waterproof clothing and that he did not take his backpack.|||Binswanger said weather limited search efforts Wednesday, the night Cayman went missing.|||Wednesday it was rainy and Thursday there was 6-8 inches of snow.|||Hundreds of volunteers have stepped up to pass out fliers and to canvass areas, according to posts.|||A post late Saturday explained search efforts included "advanced, geo-spacial tracking software to determine the exact locations where searchers went," and added that the search would be taken to the skies Sunday with deployment of the Civil Air Patrol.|||In many posts, the families appealed directly to their son.|||"Cayman, if you read this please know that you are forgiven for everything, and I mean everything, you have the ultimate free pass.|||Just come home, we are so worried about you" the family posted Saturday.|||A message to families from the head of The Shipley School, which Cayman attends, read in part: "Cayman's sister Savannah is in ninth grade at Shipley and his parents, Farid and Becky, are terrific people.|||They have contacted police and are aware that we are sending you this email.|||We hope that Cayman is ok and are saying our prayers."|||CNN could not immediately get in touch with police or the FBI.

(CNN)A shooting at a bar popular with expatriates in Mali on Saturday killed five people, including French and Belgian citizens, authorities said.|||One French citizen, one Belgian and three Malians were killed in the attack in the capital of Bamako, said Gabriel Toure, director of a local hospital.|||An additional eight people were wounded, he said.|||Authorities called the shooting a "criminal and terrorist act."|||"Mali remains committed to seeking peace and will not be intimidated by those who have no other motives than to do away (with) the prospects of peace and harmony amongst the Malians," the government said in a statement.|||A North African jihadist group, al-Murabitun, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Mauritanian news agency Al Akhbar.|||The purported claim came in an audio message in which the group said it carried out the attack in retaliation for the killing of one of its leaders, Al Akhbar said.|||"Al-Murabitun may be considered a regional competitor to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)," according to the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington-based research and analysis firm.|||The U.S. State Department said in January that al-Murabitun is a "newly-formed" militant group that has presence in northern Mali.|||French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the victim from his country was 31 years old.|||French President Francois Hollande released a statement condemning the attack.|||U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed his condolences to the victims' families in a news conference in Paris on Saturday.|||"This is an act of cowardice," he said.|||"But an act of opening fire in a restaurant filled with innocent civilians -- in the end, that only strengthens our resolve to fight terrorism in all of its forms, wherever it exists."|||The French Embassy in Bamako warned its citizens to be on alert if they go out in public.|||Though it's unclear whether any rebel group is responsible for the attack, Malian forces have battled Islamist militants in the northern part of the nation for years.|||Fabius said the Malian government was interrogating some suspects.|||Mali plunged into chaos after soldiers staged a coup three years ago.|||As a result, Tuareg fighters capitalized on the power vacuum to launch an insurgency that ended with their takeover of the north.|||After the Tuareg fighters seized the region, a power struggle erupted with local Islamist radicals.|||The extremists toppled the tribe and seized control of a large piece of northern Mali, an area the size of France.|||Since then, the nation has battled various rebel factions, mostly in the northern region, with the help of French and African forces.|||CNN's Brian Walker, Joshua Berlinger and Christabelle Fombu contributed to this report.
